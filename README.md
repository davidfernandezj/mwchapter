# Middleware Chapter

This is a standard Spring Boot project with training purposes. 

**The challenges:**

- Implement all the `//TODO: Implement me` of the `EmployeeServiceImpl` in order to get a success of all the `EmployeeServiceTest` tests
- Implement all the `//TODO: Implement me` of the `FibonacciServiceImpl` in order to get a success of all the `FibonacciServiceTest` tests. Take into account also the performance (in time, memory, etc.) of the solution.
- Implement all the `//TODO: Implement me` of the `KeyboardServiceImpl` in order to get a success of all the `KeyboardServiceTest` tests. More information about the problem that this KeyboardService resolves in the [KeyboardService.md](KeyboardService.md)

**The constrains:**

- You have to use only streams and not any for loop.
- Avoid using null checks, use Optional instead.

**The secret solutions:**

The .encoded files represent a possible solution for the problems. 
You can use the _MWChapterSolutionEncoder.java_ class to decode these solutions, if you know the password :)
