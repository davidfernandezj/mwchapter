# Middleware Chapter

This is a standard Spring Boot project with training purposes. 

The challenges:

- Implement all the `//TODO: Implement me` in order to get a success of all the `EmployeeServiceTest` tests
- Implement the `FibonacciService` in order to get a success of all the `FibonacciServiceTest` tests. Take into account also the performance (in time, memory, etc.) of the solution


The constrains:

- You have to use only streams and not any for loop.
- Avoid using null checks, use Optional instead.
